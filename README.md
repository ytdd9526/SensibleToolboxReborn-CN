> Paint Brush/Roller:
> - Right clicking the Paint Can will no longer open the GUI when refilling a brush or roller
> Redstone Clock:
> - Right click event now canceled when opening GUI
> Sender Module:
> - Fixed sending items to tile entities like chests and hoppers
> Speed Upgrade (Machine):
> - Can now be applied to all auto farming machines
> Tape Measure:
> - Output text now shows distance from anchor and total blocks in measurement
> Other:
> - Numerous exploits fixed
> - Removed > PlayerItemHeldEvent canceling
> - Land Markers no longer work on STB machines
> - Vanilla inventory insertion fixed
> - Enchantments are now hidden from glowing items
